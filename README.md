# Flight-System-Management
A flight management system with features of booking, canceling, checking availability, etc. implementing concept of multithreading, built in java, was capable of processing multiple transactions at a single moment, using locally made database. Concurrency management was done using two-phase locking scheme. It also compared the rate of transaction handled in a multithreaded vs. sequential processing environment.
We used this to plot a graph between the no of threads vs the no of transactions completed in a fixed time interval.
